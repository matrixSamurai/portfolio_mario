# Reflection on AI-Assisted Portfolio Development

Working on my portfolio website with the use of AI-assisted coding development tools has been an incredibly transformative experience that has shifted my perspective on software development. The experience with AI-assisted programming with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS has proved to be enlightening.

The area that caught my attention was the use of context and maintaining consistency within an application. When asking AI to enable game mode, it didn't only respond with the suggestions of the game but also color schemes of those games. This was something that would need to be constantly corrected if carried out manually. Another surprising element was the application’s coding capability that AI possessed.

AI was most beneficial in starting phase of the project. The repeated work of starting Next.js projects with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS was taken care of immediately. Making component layouts and similar designs in various projects was also something that AI was useful in doing. It was also an excellent debugging aid, particularly with TypeScript/design bugs, it was faster to identify and solve bugs compared to me doing it manually. Yet, it was most inefficient in situations wherein I requested more in-depth architecture explanations/design choices. Quite often, those queries yielded broad answers that didn't relate to me. This allowed it to be faster development processes. Rather than doing strict planning sessions, prototyping and rapid development took place instead.

The most critical one has always been human intuition, the use of intuition to identify the values that are most desirable and important. While AI models are capable of performing tasks, the process had to be decomposed to smaller tasks that AI models can process. The areas in which I organized my project include category setup, function, design, and features. The question that might be asked instead of “Make a portfolio” includes “Create a header with my name, job title, and network links with responsive design,” among others. The initial design that I utilized was the architecture design to ensure that there is consistency.

My prompting approach also changed over time. From initial prompting such as “make it look better” to something more accurate like “add a 2rem margin between sections and a border,” this helped me to include more design information and understand where to ask for explanations rather than code. Even with complex functionalities such as dynamic routing, this was possible.

The areas that need to be reviewed are functionalities within the codes, integration tests, and tests that offer efficiencies during performance. The review was intended to ensure that the codes satisfy the objectives and are standardized in terms of React and TypeScript rules. In the next review process, more planning should be done with initial designs and styles that include comments to facilitate understanding.

This experience made me quite optimistic about software development. The truth about AI is that it does not replace programmers. Instead, it enhances them. Software development has evolved from mere coding to architecture, problem-solving, and quality assurance. AI has made entry easier but the expectations are higher. The requirement has shifted to higher conceptual and architecture levels. Working with AI has become an essential skill. Coding has evolved to include system thinking and problem-solving. The latter requires reading, debugging, and testing coding produced by AI. Familiarity with algorithms, data structures, and design patterns is important to analyze coding produced by AI.

The use of AI will continue in setup and debugging by me while applying individual expertise in design and architecture. Validation of every outcome produced by AI will have to be done, coding will also be continued to ensure fluency. AI fails to produce creativity, design, or understanding about environments in businesses. They are not familiar with collaboration, communication, and critical thinking, which are uniquely preserved functions in the human domain. Functionality and safety are taken care of by the developer. This has opened my eyes to the potential that exists within the union of creativity and precision. It has allowed me to complete design work within a fraction of the time that it would take as if I had to work on it myself. Rather than doing the work, it felt more as though I was optimizing my own capacity to complete critical analysis. The true potential within engineering concepts exists within taking those concepts and bringing them to fruition faster than we are capable of doing. The use of AI has transformed my development paradigm. It has increased efficiency and speeds as well as opened the doors to greater creativity. It has also made me realize and appreciate the importance of expertise and critical thinking in programming. The future is for those programmers who know how to team up with AI. A proficient team is essential to fully exploit the capabilities that AI offers. The aim should be to get programmers who know nothing about AI to be replaced by programmers who are familiar with AI. Working on this project has made me ready to face that reality.
